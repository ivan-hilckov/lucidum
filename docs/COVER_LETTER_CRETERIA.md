### 4. Professional Tone and Language

- Uses action verbs and confident, forward-looking language.
- Maintains a positive, enthusiastic tone without being overly emotional or manipulative.

### 5. Psychological Impact and Persuasion

- Demonstrates social proof (e.g., brief mention of awards, recognition, or positive feedback).
- Highlights authority through credentials and certifications.
- Incorporates storytelling elements or memorable anecdotes when appropriate.
- Concludes with a clear call to action (e.g., request for interview) and thanks the recipient.

### 6. Compliance and Appropriateness
